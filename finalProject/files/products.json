Well, hit it hard and it chips no finish flaws though;the tuners suck so bad it's hard to describe tuning it is a real pain.It doesn't go out too quickly.I guess; just to practice on if you don't care what it sounds like at all",

First of all, there's a slight buzzing problem on the sixth string; especially if you're not pressing hard. Also, the strings that came on it were very low quality; On several strings I couldn't even get a note below the 12th fret; but I put Elixirs on it and that's fixed",
